## What is KMSPico?
 
KMSPico is a software tool that can activate Microsoft Windows and Office products by emulating a Key Management Service (KMS) server. KMS is a technology that Microsoft uses to activate devices deployed in bulk (e.g., in a corporate environment). KMSPico mimics the KMS server on your computer and tricks Windows and Office into thinking that they are activated by a legitimate KMS server.
